Website.me is a free service provided by World Wide Web Hosting that provides
a Single Sign On solution for cPanel and WordPress accounts. I was the project
lead and helped with its initial implementation and deployment with another
developer. The application was written using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL,
jQuery, Coffeescript, and SCSS, and integrated directly with our in-house
billing system, Helix.
