Trackmaster was an internal dashboard I built for ViaTalk to track employee
work trends and support/billing call history. It pulled data from ViaTalk's
phone and email support systems to deliver real-time statistics, and included a
Firefox extension used by the Shipping and Porting teams to track their daily
jobs.

I wasn't given database access initially and had to resort to scraping XML feeds
to pull some of the data — my first experience with creative data extraction
under constraints. This was also my first browser extension. More importantly,
Trackmaster was the project that started to convince my bosses I should focus
more on application development rather than the systems administration work I'd
been doing. It marked the beginning of my shift toward full-time software
engineering.
