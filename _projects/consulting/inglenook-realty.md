  Custom CMS and website for a local real estate agency, with ongoing
  upgrades over several years.
---

I built the website and a custom content management system for Inglenook Realty
using CodeIgniter and MySQL. The CMS let the client manage property listings
and site content without needing technical knowledge. I worked directly with
the client to fine-tune the site to their specifications and performed several
rounds of upgrades over the years as their needs and the real estate market
evolved.
