I developed three major versions of the Creative Dance Arts website over 11
years, including two custom WordPress themes. The final version (v3) was a
full-featured membership site with class registration, faculty directory,
events, a newsletter, and a member portal with login and password management.

The most interesting technical piece was the automated registration pipeline:
custom WordPress templates collected class registration data, a PHP script
converted the submissions to PDF using DomPDF, and a cron job processed pending
forms, archived them, and emailed the PDFs to the studio. I also set up
Capistrano deployment with staging and production environments, wp-cli for
command-line management, and backup automation.

I trained the Artistic Director on WordPress content management and provided
ongoing support for the site's 200+ active users during class sessions. This
was my longest client relationship — a project that grew from a simple
static site into a functional web application over a decade.
