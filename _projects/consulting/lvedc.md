I rebuilt the LVEDC website from ColdFusion (with Macromedia Contribute for
content management) into a CodeIgniter application with MySQL. I'd never even
seen ColdFusion code before accepting the job, but the existing application was
straightforward enough that the port went quickly.

The new site was a commercial real estate portal where businesses could search
available properties — buildings and sites for lease or sale — filtered by
zoning, acreage, square footage, and industrial park. Each property had a
detail page with specifications and contact information. The admin panel let
staff manage property listings, user accounts, and activity logs. I also built
the contact form with US phone number validation and email notifications.
