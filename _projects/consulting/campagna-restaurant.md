  DevOps consulting for a Statamic restaurant site — automated deployments,
  staging environments, monitoring, and integration testing.
---

I worked with Allusis Productions to automate the deployment process for
Campagna Restaurant's Statamic site. The existing PHP deployment workflow left
the site vulnerable to bugs and downtime with no way to test changes before
they went live.

I configured the application to support staging and production environments
with Capistrano-based automated deployments, added caching, set up monitoring
and integration testing, and created an easy backup system. The goal was a
deployment workflow where the site owner could push changes confidently —
test on staging, deploy to production, and roll back instantly if anything
went wrong.
