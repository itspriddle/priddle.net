I developed the Rails application for LRT Sports, a website that helps student
athletes through the college recruiting process. My work involved replacing an
existing coach and school search directory with a fully custom one. The Rails
application is responsible for pulling information from a third party API for
coaches and schools, and formatting the date for use in student searches and
ratings. Recently, I implemented a new recurring subscription service.
