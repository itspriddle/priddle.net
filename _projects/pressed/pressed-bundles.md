Pressed Bundles allow customers to order web hosting with preinstalled
WordPress themes. I was the lead developer tasked with automating the
installation process of several dozen WordPress themes, in many cases
implementing custom WP-CLI plugins. I also lead the integration of this
installation process into our custom Rails-based billing system, including
general record keeping and the customer order UI/UX.
