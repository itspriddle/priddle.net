The Pressed Partner Panel allows brands to manage their web hosting customer
and sales with Pressed. It includes a variety of reports based on customer
data, protected when necessary. A custom permission system allows different
partners different levels of access to data and troubleshooting tools. I was a
lead developer on the project and helped ship the initial version.
