The Pressed MWP Order Form is a white-labeled form available to different
brands. It allows their customers to order Managed WordPress hosting. Customer
information is stored in a Rails billing system and used to provision their
websites. I was a lead developer involved with several different
implementations of the order form over the years, including the front end UI
and the backend provisioning process.
