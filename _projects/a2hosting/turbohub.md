TurboHub is a custom Laravel application that integrates with WHMCS,
WordPress, and other services to provide a streamlined process for deploying
and managing WordPress sites. It uses RabbitMQ for message queuing, Redis for
caching, and a custom Laravel wrapper for WP-CLI that is distributed to over
5,000 metal and virtual servers. I was responsible for the initial project
architecture and I led a team of 12 developers to bring the project from an
MVP to a fully functional application servicing over 385,000 WordPress sites
for 100,000 customers.
