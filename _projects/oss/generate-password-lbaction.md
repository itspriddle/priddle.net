This is a [LaunchBar 6][] Action to generate secure passwords and copy them to
the system clipboard.

It uses the [KeePass Password Generator][] to allow you to specify a character
set for the generated password. This functionality is provided by an included
copy of the [keepass-password-generator RubyGem][] -- no external dependencies
are required.

## Installation

Grab "Generate.Password.zip" from the latest release at
<https://github.com/itspriddle/generate-password.lbaction/releases>. Unzip and
open "Generate Password.lbaction" to install it.

## Usage

To generate a password, invoke LaunchBar and select "Generate Password". After
running the action, the newly generated password is copied to the system
clipboard.

By default, this Action will generate a 20 character password using
`L{9}d{9}s{9}` as the KeePass character set. This will generate a password
with 9 mixes-case letters, 9 digits, and 2 special characters.

To specify a different character set, press `Space` after selecting the Action
from LaunchBar and type in the desired character set, eg: `S{30}`.

## Preferences

If you want to use a different default character set, you can create or edit
`~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Action Support/io.github.itspriddle.LaunchBar.action.GeneratePassword/Preferences.plist`
and set `defaultFormat`.

For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>defaultFormat</key>
	<string>S{30}</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```
