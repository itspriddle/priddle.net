  I found myself copying Bash scripts from project to project, so I created
  LCARS (Laravel CLI and Reusable Scripts) to provide a unified command-line
  interface for common Laravel tasks, testing tools, and development
  utilities.
---

LCARS (Laravel CLI and Reusable Scripts) is a command-line toolkit that
enhances Laravel development workflows with convenient utilities and
shortcuts. It provides quick access to common Laravel tasks, testing tools,
development utilities, and documentation browsingâ€”all through a unified CLI
interface.

Key features:

- **Testing Suite**: Run Pest, PHPStan, Pint, and ShellCheck with simple
  commands
- **Documentation**: Browse Laravel docs with fuzzy search using `fzf`
- **Development Utilities**: Hash generation, HTTP header and SSL inspection,
  clipboard operations, and more

## Installation

### Install globally via Homebrew on macOS

On macOS, `lcars` can be installed via Homebrew with:

```
brew install built-fast/devtools/lcars
```

### Install globally via make

macOS and most Linux distributions add `/usr/local/bin` to `$PATH` and
`/usr/local/share/man` to `$MANPATH`. If you are the only user on the machine,
or if you want to make `lcars` available for all users, you can install
it globally as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/built-fast/lcars
cd lcars
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local
```

### Install locally via make

If you don't want a global installation, another common pattern is to install
to `~/.local`. This is enabled on Ubuntu by default.

```
git clone https://github.com/built-fast/lcars
cd lcars
make install PREFIX=~/.local
```

To test, verify that `lcars help` works and that `man lcars` prints the man
page.

If you see `lcars: command not found`, you need to update your `$PATH`.
If you are using Bash, add the following to `~/.bash_profile`, or if you are
using ZSH, add it to `~/.zshenv`:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

If `man lcars` reports `No manual entry for lcars`, you need to
update your `$MANPATH`. This can be done by adding the following to
`~/.manpath` (note, change USER to your username):

```
MANDATORY_MANPATH /home/USER/.manpath
```
