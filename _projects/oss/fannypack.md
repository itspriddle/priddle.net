excerpt: |
  FannyPack is a RubyGem that interfaces with the
  [Fantastico](https://www.netenberg.com/fantastico.php) API. I created the
  initial implementation and helped manage the open source project on GitHub.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (If you want to have
  your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
  ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
