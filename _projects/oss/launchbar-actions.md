Just a few [LaunchBar][] Actions I use. See [the repo]({{ page.github }}) for
more info.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git://github.com/itspriddle/launcbar-actions
cd launchbar-actions
sh install.sh
mv build/* ~/Library/Application\ Support/LaunchBar/Actions/
```

### Adium

These AppleScripts change your away/online status. With the action selected in LaunchBar,
press spacebar to input a custom status.

**[Adium - Away](https://github.com/itspriddle/launchbar-actions/raw/master/scripts/Adium%20-%20Away.scpt)**
