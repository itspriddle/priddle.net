Author Managed Designs is a project that allows WordPress theme authors on
Envato Hosted to manage the state of their theme that is for sale. The author
can sign in to a limited version of the Hosted Build Control Panel and
provision demo sites with their themes. They can customize the site and then
export it for use on our hosting platform. I helped with the release of the
control panel and developed the archiving system.
