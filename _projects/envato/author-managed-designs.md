  Self-service system allowing ThemeForest authors to manage their WordPress
  theme demos on Envato Hosted, with a custom archiving pipeline.
---

Author Managed Designs extended the [Bender Builds](/work/envato/bender-builds/)
system to give WordPress theme authors on ThemeForest direct control over their
hosted demos. Previously, theme bundling was an internal process — staff had
to configure and package each theme. This project opened a limited version of
the Build Control Panel to authors themselves, letting them provision demo
sites, customize the WordPress installation to showcase their theme, and export
the result for use on the Envato Hosted platform.

I helped ship the control panel and built the archiving system that packages
an author's customized demo site into a deployable archive. This was the
evolution of the bundling concept from [Pressed Bundles](/work/pressed/pressed-bundles/)
through [Bender Builds](/work/envato/bender-builds/) — each iteration gave more
control to the people closest to the content, moving from internal-only to
author self-service.
