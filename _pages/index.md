I'm Josh, a full-stack developer and leader with 20 years of experience in the
web hosting space. I love the challenge of taking an idea and creating
something out of nothing. Over the years, I've built SaaS platforms, control
panels, and billing systems that serve hundreds of thousands of customers and
websites. I'm passionate about API design and integration, and I have deep
experience with Linux systems administration. I thrive on remote, agile teams
where I can help guide technical decisions and mentor other developers.

I'm a huge proponent of open source software and love to give back to the
community. After all, I'm only able to do what I do because of thousands of
other developers doing the same. I've created and maintain dozens of projects
on [GitHub][]---everything from Vim plugins and CLI tools to Ruby gems and
WordPress plugins.

I mainly program in PHP, Ruby, and Bash. I write a little over at
[josh.fail][] and you can find me on [LinkedIn][] and on [Bluesky][].

These days I'm the Director of Software Development and a co-founder at
[BuiltFast][], a privately owned, founder-led hosting company focused on
bringing true service back to the hosting space. We believe that great hosting
is still possible, and we're excited to prove it.
