I'm Josh, a full stack developer and leader with over 15 years of experience
designing and maintaining SaaS platforms, control panels, and billing systems
using Ruby on Rails. Expert in API server and client implementation and
integration. I have an extensive background in web hosting and Linux systems
administration and I'm highly productive on remote, agile teams.

I mainly program in Ruby, PHP, and Bash. Check out [my projects on
GitHub][GitHub]. I write a little over at [josh.fail][].

I'm looking for a new development or leadership role in a Ruby shop as of
February 2025 â€” ping me at jpriddle [at] me.com to chat!
