          <h3>ViaTalk Terms of Service Agreement</h3>
          <div style="height:400px; overflow-y:scroll; border:1px solid #ccc; padding:15px; margin-bottom:15px; font-size:12px; line-height:1.6">
            <h4>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h4>
            <p>By subscribing to and/or using ViaTalk's broadband telephone service ("Service"), you ("Customer" or "You") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("TOS"). ViaTalk, LLC ("ViaTalk," "we," or "us") reserves the right to update or modify these TOS at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of the Service following any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised TOS. If you do not agree to these terms, you must immediately discontinue use of the Service and contact ViaTalk to cancel your account.</p>

            <h4>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h4>
            <p>ViaTalk provides Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") telephone service that allows you to make and receive telephone calls over a broadband Internet connection. The Service requires a compatible broadband Internet connection (DSL, cable modem, or similar), an Analog Telephone Adapter ("ATA") provided by ViaTalk or a compatible device, and a standard analog telephone. ViaTalk does not provide Internet access. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining your own broadband Internet connection. Service quality depends on the quality and bandwidth of your Internet connection.</p>

            <h4>3. E911 EMERGENCY SERVICES</h4>
            <p>IMPORTANT: The E911 service provided by ViaTalk differs from traditional 911 service. You must register your physical address with ViaTalk so that emergency calls can be properly routed. If you move your equipment to a different location, you must update your address immediately through your control panel or by contacting customer service. ViaTalk E911 service may not function during power outages, Internet outages, or if your equipment is not properly configured. ViaTalk shall not be liable for any service outage and/or inability to dial 911 or to access emergency service personnel.</p>

            <h4>4. BILLING AND PAYMENT</h4>
            <p>You agree to pay all applicable fees and charges associated with your selected plan. Monthly plans are billed in advance on the same date each month. Annual plans are billed as a single payment for the full year. All fees are non-refundable unless otherwise stated. ViaTalk reserves the right to change pricing with 30 days advance notice. Failure to pay may result in suspension or termination of your Service. Late payments may incur additional fees. Applicable taxes and regulatory fees are additional and will be added to your invoice.</p>

            <h4>5. ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY</h4>
            <p>The Service is provided for normal residential or business use. You may not use the Service for auto-dialing, continuous or extensive call forwarding, telemarketing, fax broadcasting, fax blasting, or any other use that would be inconsistent with normal individual use patterns. ViaTalk reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate your Service if we determine, in our sole discretion, that your use of the Service is inconsistent with normal residential or business use. You may not resell or transfer the Service to any third party without ViaTalk's prior written consent. You may not use the Service for any unlawful, abusive, or fraudulent purpose.</p>
