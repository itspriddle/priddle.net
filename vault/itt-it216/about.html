<h2>about this <span>site</span></h2>
<p>This site was created for ITT's IT216 (Perl and CGI in a Linux Environment). <br /><br /> It uses cgi.pm to create
any HTML needed. ('Here documents' are used for forms).<br /><br />The HTML itself, is fully standards compliant,
and organized in such a way that the overall style of this site is easily changed by simply dropping a new CSS file on the
server.<br /><br />When forms are submitted, the information is validated using regular expressions to ensure that the user
has actually submitted what was expected.  If they enter <strong>incorrect</strong> information, they return to the sign form
which will now display the validation error.<br /><br />On the guestbook, submissions are stored in a flat text file.  For the contact
form, this information is stored within a MySQL database.<br /><br />Graphics for this site, were created for IT201 last Feb. by Tony Montemorano.
The CSS and HTML for that site were created by myself, and then imported into Perl.<br /><br />All in all, creating this site was a great
learning experience for me, however, I highly doubt you'll see <strong>#!/usr/bin/perl</strong> at the top of any of my future scripts.</p>
